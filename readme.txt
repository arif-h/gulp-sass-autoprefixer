copy these three files & css folder into our project folder.
from cli type "npm install"
all necessary packages will be downloaded automatically.
Thus we are ready to use sass to compile css with autoprefixer.
A style.css file and style.css.maps will be generated automatically.

if we want minified version of css, then we can configure from gulpfile.js
Thats it.
